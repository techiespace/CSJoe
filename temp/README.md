# CSJoe

CSJoe aims to offer a detailed roadmap of computer science engineering to aspiring learners. We will do this by using an opensource database encompassing all computer science topics categorised and labelled with levels. This enables students to acquire an in-depth knowledge of the subjects of their choice.

## Getting Started

Import the project in Android Studio and Run it on your device.

### Database

CSJoe uses cloud firestore database

### Coding style

Use indentation as suggested by Androoid Studio.
